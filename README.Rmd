## Installation

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can install the development version of PLEIOVAR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LEPSNES/PLEIOVAR")
=======
You can install the development version of PLEIOVAR like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

<<<<<<< HEAD
### PC-SNP

This is one step of PLEIOVAR pipeline to generate genewise principle components. 

```{r example}
library(PLEIOVAR)
infolder <- system.file("extdata", "pc_snp", package = "PLEIOVAR")
outfolder <- "dev/func_output"
OPF_snp <-  0.75
freq_cut <-  0.005
block_name <-  "blocktest"
pc_snp(infolder, outfolder, OPF_snp, freq_cut, block_name)
```

To get help

```{r}
?pc_snp
```
=======
```{r example}
library(PLEIOVAR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
